Anytime Multi-Agent Path Finding via Large Neighborhood Search


MAPF-LNS is an effifent anytime algorithm for solving Multi-Agent Path Finding (MAPF). 
More details can be found in our paper at IJCAI 2021 [1]. 

Note: The code used in the IJCAI paper had a typo for the agent-based neighborhood selection method. After fixing this typo (commit [3e03f6e](https://github.com/Jiaoyang-Li/MAPF-LNS/commit/3e03f6ed6f59194cde1b95362b66aca8e11c639e)), the method performs better than what was reported in the paper.

A stronger version MAPF-LNS2 can be found here: https://github.com/Jiaoyang-Li/MAPF-LNS2

The code requires the external libraries 
BOOST (https://www.boost.org/) and Eigen (https://eigen.tuxfamily.org/). 
An easy way to install the required libraries on Ubuntu:    
```shell script
sudo apt update
```
- Install the Eigen library (used for linear algebra computing)
    ```shell script
    sudo apt install libeigen3-dev
    ```
- Install the boost library 
    ```shell script
    sudo apt install libboost-all-dev
    ```
    
After you installed both libraries and downloaded the source code, 
go into the directory of the source code and compile it with CMake: 
```
cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=RELEASE .
make
```

You also need to download the MAPF instances from the MAPF benchmark (https://movingai.com/benchmarks/mapf/index.html). In particular, the format of the scen files is explained here: https://movingai.com/benchmarks/formats.html. For a given number of agents k, the first k rows of the scen file are used to generate the k pairs of start and target locations.

Then, you are able to run the code:
```
./lns -m random-32-32-20.map -a random-32-32-20-random-1.scen -o test.csv -k 50 -t 60
```

- m: the map file from the MAPF benchmark
- a: the scenario file from the MAPF benchmark
- o: the output file
- k: the number of agents
- t: the runtime limit

You can find more details and explanations for all parameters with:
```
./lns --help
```
